# Image-Generation-using-GANS-using-PyTorch-and-Cifar-10
It is computer vision GAN project using PyTorch as backend for making Generator and Discriminator neural networks to produce fake images from noises. The test images used for training is Cifar-10 image data set which includes various images of animals, vehicles, items etc. The outputs after each epoch are saved as a single collage image.
